### Recurrent Neural Network to solve NLP problem


Project overview given from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started/overview):

*In this competition, you’re challenged to build a machine learning model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which one’s aren’t. You’ll have access to a dataset of 10,000 tweets that were hand classified. If this is your first time working on an NLP problem, we've created a quick tutorial to get you up and running.*

The notebook within this subfolder contains EDA, RNN model building and training
